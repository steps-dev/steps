## **steps**: Spatially- and Temporally-Explicit Population Simulator

[![codecov.io](https://codecov.io/github/skiptoniam/steps/coverage.svg?branch=master)](https://codecov.io/github/skiptoniam/steps?branch=master)

The package will enable the setup and execution of dynamic spatial habitat (landscape/seascape) meta-population models with demographic processes in R.

You can install the development version from GitHub, including the example vignette, with:
```{r install, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("steps-dev/steps", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```
